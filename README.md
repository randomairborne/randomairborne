### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student in the U.S. working on Rust, HTML, and CSS. JavaScript only when absolutely nessecary.

### Current Status
I am [out of office](https://www.randomairborne.dev/away) until August 11, 2024. 
Niko is my contact for this time being. You can ask them if you have any burning questions. 

It's interesting that the super-streak (329 days, August 20, 2023 to July 14, 2024) is ending this way. 
Thank you all (especially Experienced's users) for giving me the motivation and the feature requests to work on.
